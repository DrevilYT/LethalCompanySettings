# LethalCompanySettings
A config of Lethal Company for low-end devices.

# Info
To use this config, you need BepinEx and the HDLethalCompany mod installed.

# Requirements
- BepinEx
- HDLethalCompany Mod

# Links
- BepinEx: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases
- HDLethalCompany: https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Sligili/HDLethalCompany/
- Raw Config File: https://drev.uk.to/thecompany/mods/hdlethalcompany/config/HDLethalCompany.cfg

# Method 1
- Get the file from releases. (or from the raw config file link above?
- Copy or move it to (your game directory)\BepInEx\config
- If it asks you what you want to do with the old file, then select replace.

# Method 2 (Run in Powershell)
- cd (game directory here)\BepInEx\config
- ren HDLethalCompany.cfg HDLethalCompany_default.cfg
- curl -L -0 HDLethalCompany.cfg "https://drev.uk.to/thecompany/mods/hdlethalcompany/config/HDLethalCompany.cfg"

# Extra Optimization
- This doesn't require any mods.
- Just go to your Steam library.
- Right-click on the Lethal Company game and select properties.
- At the launch options, type "-screen-width 1280 -screen-height 720"
- Make sure you type it without the quotes or quoation marks (").
- You can change the values to set a resolution in game.
- The one I gave or put above is 720p.
- If your game still lags, try this.
- "-screen-width 800 -screen-height 600"
- Again, make sure you type it without the quotes or quoation marks (").
